I am a long-time Detective Conan enthusiast and I love the OST. I decided to create a manga reader that plays the OST while you read the manga. The tech stack is Next.js, Supabase, and Google Cloud Storage for hosting images and audio, Google Gemini for image classification, Cloud Functions coupled with Cloud Tasks for background processing and job queueing, the whole app is hosted as a container on Google Cloud Run, and a CI/CD pipeline set up with Cloud Build for automated build and deployment.
